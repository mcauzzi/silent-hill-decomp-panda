// Publisher metadata is intentionally filled in (not blank): empty
// Company/Description/Trademark fields are a known antivirus ML-heuristic signal,
// and a stable, consistent identity across nightly builds lets reputation accrue
// instead of resetting. See pc_port/docs/Launcher_Antivirus_Notes.md.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// AssemblyFileVersion is date-based (yyyy.M.d.rev) and is the ordering used to
// decide launcher self-updates: the launcher only replaces itself when an
// incoming build's launcher_version is STRICTLY GREATER than this. BUMP THIS
// every time the launcher exe changes (and the release will carry it in
// version.json), otherwise downgrades/no-ops can't be told apart. AssemblyVersion
// stays 1.0.0.0 so it isn't a binding identity churn.
