 * Laid out in units of screen HEIGHT, never width. Height is the stable
 * dimension in landscape: an 18:9 phone and a 4:3 tablet differ enormously in
 * width but put the thumbs at the same place relative to height, so this keeps
 * every control the same physical size and leaves the wide middle -- where the
 * game is -- clear.
 *
 * Raw PSX bits, not controllerConfig binds. This IS a pad, so a face button
 * has to be the button it is drawn as; routing it through the rebindable
 * action names would make Circle stop being Circle the moment someone remapped
 * anything. The word is active-low and ANDed into the pad, same as above.
 *
 * These are the RAW pad-buffer bits, not libetc.h's PAD* names: the raw report
 * is a little-endian u_short whose two bytes are SWAPPED relative to what
 * PadRead() returns, so PADRup and friends would compile cleanly here and
 * silently turn triangle into d-pad up. */

 * screen drawn 4:3 (save/load, the paper map, brightness) it still held the
 * WIDE gameplay frame. The corner button landed past the 4:3 picture's right
 * edge and was clipped, while its hit test, which maps the finger into the
