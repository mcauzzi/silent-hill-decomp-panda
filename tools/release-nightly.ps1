# Silent Hill PC nightly release script
#
# Two release modes (prompted if -Mode is not given):
#
#   loose  - the original per-file flow. Hashes the local build files, diffs
#            them against the previous loose release's version.json, creates a
#            release on the default branch, and uploads ONLY the changed files +
#            a new version.json. Used for the public/stable stream and for the
#            final loose build before everyone is on the zip-capable launcher.
#
#   zip    - bundles the whole launchable file set (everything in the reference
#            SHPC_Alpha8.zip EXCEPT the disc image and the save .MCD files) from
#            the build folder into one timestamped .zip, and publishes it as a
#            release on the dedicated `beta` branch (auto-created on first use)
#            together with a small version.json (per-file hashes + the zip URL)
#            so the launcher can do a cheap update check and only pull the zip
#            when it actually needs to apply. No pre-release hash diff is done in
#            zip mode -- the maintainer is the only publisher, so every run
#            produces a release.
#
# Both modes prepend an auto-generated section to CHANGELOG.md (from commit
# subjects since the previous release of the SAME stream) and PAUSE so it can be
# hand-edited before anything is hashed/zipped/uploaded.
#
#   custom - a NAMED build for users to opt into (a modded or experimental
#            build such as an open-world test): -Name "Open World Test". Always
#            a zip release, published as a PRERELEASE on the `custom` branch
#            with tag custom-<slug>-YYYY.MM.DD.N. The launcher lists it under
#            Branch "Custom builds" by its name; it never counts as "latest"
#            for anyone (the launcher orders by the version in beta-/v tags, a
#            custom tag parses as 0, and GitHub's own latest skips prereleases),
#            so a normal release afterwards is NOT needed. No CHANGELOG.md
#            section is written and the cross-platform CI gate is skipped, since
#            the build usually comes from a branch CI never built. The LAUNCHER
#            is left out of a custom build unless -WithLauncher is passed: the
#            launcher self-updates on version alone and never downgrades, so a
#            build meant to be opt-in would otherwise hand its launcher to every
#            tester and keep it there after they switch back. Pass -WithLauncher
#            only when the launcher itself is what you are testing.
#
# Usage:
#   .\tools\release-nightly.ps1 [-Mode zip|loose] [-DryRun] [-BuildDir path]
#                               [-Notes string] [-NoPause] [-BetaBranch beta]
#                               [-SkipCrossPlatform]
#   .\tools\release-nightly.ps1 -Name "Open World Test" [-WithLauncher]
#                               [-Notes string] [-DryRun]
#
# Linux + macOS builds are included BY DEFAULT and are VERIFIED BEFORE anything
# is published: the release is NOT created until the build-linux.yml /
# build-macos.yml CI runs for THIS EXACT commit have finished successfully on the
# source repo. Their artifacts are attached as standalone zips, kept OUT of
# version.json so the Windows launcher ignores them. Pass -SkipCrossPlatform for
# a deliberate Windows-only release.
#
# Cross-platform gate (runs BEFORE the release is created -- so a not-ready build
# aborts the WHOLE release instead of leaving a half-published one):
#   - all matching builds succeeded -> download + proceed silently.
#   - a build is still running       -> WAIT for it (gh run watch) to finish.
#   - a build FAILED / has no run / the commit isn't pushed -> STOP and prompt:
#       [A] Abort        - publish NOTHING (default).
#       [R] Re-check     - poll CI again (after a build finishes).
#       [P] Push         - push the branch to the source repo, then re-check.
#       [S] Windows-only - publish with NO Linux/macOS assets.
#       [O] Old builds   - attach mismatched, older builds (must type OLD).
#     It NEVER silently attaches a stale build and NEVER publishes a partial
#     release without an explicit choice.
# Pass -NoPause (unattended): if the matching builds aren't ready the release is
# ABORTED (nothing published) rather than shipping stale artifacts. -DryRun
# reports CI status but publishes nothing.
#
# Requires:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated (gh auth login).
#   - Build artifacts present in pc_port/build/ (run cmake --build first).
#   - Repo SlickAmogus/silent-hill-pc-nightly already created on GitHub.
